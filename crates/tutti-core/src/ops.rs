//! The signed operation envelope — a durable, gossiped, per-author append-only
//! op log built on `p2panda-core`, domain-agnostic over an [`OpLanguage`].
//!
//! Every domain contribution becomes an `L::Op` wrapped in a [`VersionedOpG`]
//! envelope, CBOR-encoded as a p2panda `Body`, and signed by the author's Ed25519
//! key via `Header::sign`. Verification runs `validate_operation` plus the
//! domain's `L::validate_wire`, so who contributed which op is cryptographically
//! established before it can reach a store write ([`VerifiedOpG`]'s fields are
//! private; the only constructor is [`verify_signed_op_in`]).
//!
//! These signed ops are the source of truth; the HHHS causal-DAG mirror
//! ([`crate::store`]) lifts them into a read model.
//!
//! **Evolution discipline (stated generically, was walkie's):** append variants
//! to `L::Op`, never reorder them, add fields only as `#[serde(default)]`, and
//! bump [`OpLanguage::SCHEMA_VERSION`] when the payload shape changes.
//!
//! **wasm timestamps:** `ts_micros` must be author-supplied. On wasm pass
//! `js_sys::Date::now() as u64 * 1000`; never call p2panda's `Timestamp::now()`
//! (it uses `SystemTime::now()`, which panics on `wasm32`).
