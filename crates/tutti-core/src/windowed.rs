//! M3.0 — the bounded window — plus **M3.1 monotone-shadowing compaction**
//! (`docs/vision/windowed-store-design.md` §7 "M3.0"/"M3.1", §6.1, §3, §2.4-2.6).
//!
//! Two types, mirroring the kernel's own [`MemDagStore`](hhhs::MemDagStore)
//! vs [`Store<L>`](crate::Store) split (design §6.1):
//!
//! - [`WindowedDag`] — the L-free kernel piece: a bounded suffix window of a causal
//!   DAG with dense window indices and an incremental **index-compressed bitset
//!   reach** (§3.3). It implements [`DagRead`], and provides the bounded-window
//!   [`WindowedDag::appended_since`] (the `DagDelta` contract: `Some` inside the
//!   window, **`None` past it**, dag.rs:228-235). While `N ≤ W` it retains the
//!   *entire* DAG and is therefore exactly a [`MemDagStore`].
//! - [`WindowedStore<L>`] — the leaf-profile sibling of [`Store<L>`](crate::Store):
//!   the same lift / strict-deferral / drain machinery over a [`WindowedDag`], a
//!   cut-scoped sync surface (§1.2, §4.2), and a fenced [`WindowedStore::view`] that
//!   folds through the boundary-aware [`WindowedReach`] backend (§3.5) via the public
//!   [`FoldCtx::over`](crate::FoldCtx::over) constructor.
//!
//! **M3.0 — the bounded window** ([`WindowedStore::with_cap`]). With `retain` left at
//! its retain-everything default, the window holds every op it lifts; while `N ≤ W`
//! the windowed fold is byte-identical to the full-history fold (§2.6) and bounded to
//! `≤ W` ops. The instant `N > W` the window would truncate — and because a plain
//! reach over a truncated DAG silently computes `is_ancestor = false` across the cut
//! (a **wrong view, not an error**, §1.3), M3.0's [`WindowedStore::view`]
//! **hard-refuses** rather than fold it. Exact only for `N ≤ W`.
//!
//! **M3.1 — monotone-shadowing compaction** ([`WindowedStore::with_window`],
//! [`WindowedStore::compact`]). At a causally-closed cut the domain's
//! [`OpLanguage::retain`] names the residue — the ops whose contribution to a *future*
//! fold is not yet **monotone-shadowed** (§2.4): killed by an unconditional remove, or
//! superseded by a retained later write; never dependent on the continued *absence* of
//! a future op. Everything else is discarded from the fold's decoded map (the
//! [`Checkpoint`]-tracked ancestry summary answers `is_ancestor` across the cut
//! exactly, §3.2/§3.4), so `L::fold` over `checkpoint ⊕ window` equals the full-history
//! fold for `N > W` (§2.6) — *iff* the domain's retention is sound, which the
//! `windowed_equiv` gate falsifies adversarially. The [`WindowedStore::view`] fence
//! relaxes from "complete" to [`WindowedStore::is_answerable`]: a compacted store is
//! not complete but *is* answerable; only an M3.0 window that hard-truncated still
//! refuses.
//!
//! **Scope (§2.5, honestly).** Compaction handles the **monotone** domains — add-wins
//! sets (survivor per-author maxima) and full-horizon causal-maxima registers (R). It
//! does **not** compact the non-monotone piece/resurrection subgraph (`Undel` makes
//! kills flip; §2.5-P) or a sub-horizon-read register (the R′ hazard, §2.5-R′); those
//! are **retained wholesale** — conservative retention is always sound ("when in doubt,
//! retain").
//!
//! **M3.2 — bounded ancestry packing** ([`PackedSummary`]). M3.1 answered `is_ancestor`
//! across the cut from an exact-but-**unbounded** summary: a full strict-ancestor *set*
//! per lifted op (Θ(N²) — the very cost windowing exists to avoid). M3.2 replaces it
//! with the design's §3.2 cut-contact / §3.3 in-window bitset / §3.4 residue reach
//! matrix, unified into **one dense retained-ancestor [`BitRow`] closure**: size
//! `O((|R|+|window|)²)` bits — **independent of total history N**, so the windowed
//! store's *memory* is now bounded to the leaf budget (§5), not just its fold input.
//! The one residual (an honest, deferred `O(N)` — far below M3.1's Θ(N²)) is
//! [`PackedSummary::discarded_reach`]: a bounded row per discarded op so a future
//! laggard referencing one still folds with **no courier**; deep-laggard courier
//! admission (§4.5) — deferred — is what would drop it.
