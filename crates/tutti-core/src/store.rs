//! [`Store<L>`]: lift verified p2panda ops into an hhhs causal DAG and fold
//! the domain read model HHHS-natively.
//!
//! Every [`VerifiedOpG`] is deterministically lifted to a kernel [`Entry`] whose
//! payload is the **verbatim framed signed bytes** of the op, and whose `prevs`
//! are the entries that lift the op's `backlink` and each of its `observed`
//! op ids. Because the payload and the prev set are both pure functions of the
//! signed op, the resulting [`EntryHash`] is identical on every peer regardless
//! of the order ops arrive — which is what makes cross-peer convergence hold.
//!
//! The read model (`L::View`) is then computed by [`OpLanguage::fold`] over the
//! causal indexes packaged into a [`FoldCtx`]: the decoded op set, the entry↔op
//! map, and a causal-ancestry oracle behind [`CausalPast`]. Ancestry in
//! production is the cheap lazy [`Reach`] (O(N + E) `prevs` adjacency, reverse-
//! walk `is_ancestor`, memoized per call) — never the whole-DAG [`ReachIndex`]
//! closure.
//!
//! Signature verification happens once, at ingest, against a [`VerifiedOpG`];
//! reads never re-verify. None of this names a domain: the alphabet, the fold
//! rule and the view type are all `L`.
